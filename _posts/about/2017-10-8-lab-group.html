<p>My name is Austin Phung and I joined the UC Davis Olive Center during my 3rd year as an undergraduate majoring in Pharmaceutical Chemistry. As an undergraduate, I took on a Senior Project that involved Method Development for both PV and FFA chemical tests. Now, as a 2nd year master's student, I'm working on a project that is split into two parts. (1) Assess the Oxidative Status of the Top 50 Fish Oil Products on the Market and (2) Assess the chemical changes during the acute oxidations of fish oils. The experiences I've gained in this lab so far have been great in improving my skills and confidence. My ultimate goal after I graduate is to work in the industry as a Research Associate or QC/QA.</p>

        <h2>Ming Ying Kwong</h2>
<p>I am Ming, a fourth year undergraduate Chemistry student. When I was young, my dietitian instructed me to eat bread soaked in olive oil for breakfast. As I kid, I hated the texture of the soggy bread and the taste of olive oil. For a long time, I associated olive oil with my dietitian and I tried to avoid it as much as I can. However, I wrote a paper on the benefits of olive oil on osteoporosis, a disease that affects many of my loved ones. Then, I joined the UC Davis Olive Center and learned more health benefits that olive oil has. Now, I associate olive oil with work and I sprinkle olive oil on my salad everyday. </p>

<p>Hi, this is Rixin Cao. I am a fourth year student majoring in Food Science and Technology. My hometown is Guangzhou, China and I plan to continue my study in a graduate school. I've been in the lab for several months. I have meet smart and friendly new friends and have already learned lots of lab techniques including methods of testing oil qualities.</p><p>
I am currently working on performing PV and FFA tests on 50 oil samples and will continue to do more experiments as well as learn more new lab techniques during my last year of studying in UC Davis. This experience also helps me to determine what I really want to do in the future. </p><p>
Olive Center is a great and warm big family where I can not only develop lab skills but also meet new friends.

<p>My name is Dee Ann Dela Cruz and I am a fourth year Food Science major, minoring in Music. I was born and raised in the bay area and I became interested in Food Science when I took an introductory course my freshman year. After taking many intro classes to various aspects of Food Science, I became more interested in a lot of different fields, specifically olive oil. My professors briefly skimmed the topic of olive oil, antioxidants, and peroxides and that was when I wanted to learn more. After graduation, I hope to use the skills and techniques I've acquired from the Olive lab to pursue a career in quality assurance or product development come June 2018.

<p>Hi! My name is Chang Lin. I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in Food Science and Technology. I am from Guangzhou, a city in southern China. I joined the UC Davis Olive center because of my strong interest in the chemistry and preservation of olive oil. I learned a lot of lab techniques and knowledge on olive oil processing after participating in the lab as a research assistant. After successfully mastering all the lab techniques, I hope I can utilize what I have learned to create my own research project in the future. In my free time, I like to learn new languages, try new cooking recipes, and take pictures of food. It is an honor to work in the lab, especially among talented researchers and other amazing interns.

<p>I am Gary Adrian, and I am a third-year Food Science major student in University of California, Davis. I first learned about the UC Davis Olive Center when I volunteered for olive oil tasting tabling event during Picnic Day 2015, and since then my interest in olive oil has kept getting bigger. Growing up not using olive oil in my food, I never know how a humble food ingredient such as olive oil can have such complex attributes that constitute its quality. In the UC Davis Olive Center, I learn about the different chemical parameters and benefits of olive oil that makes me appreciate olive oil even more. The learning process here is very eye-opening, and I am excited to learn even more on how to produce olive oil with the highest quality.

<p>My name is Haley Fang and I am an undergraduate student majoring in Food Science. I started off with the UC Davis Olive Center as a tasting intern my second year. Through this experience, I was able to familiarize myself with the oils that the school produced, learn a lot about the center, and learn what makes good olive oil. The following year, I was able to join as a lab intern. In my free time, I enjoy watching Netflix, listening to music, petting dogs, and napping.  I also like to stay active by dancing and running.

        <h2>Filipa Grilo</h2>
<p>My name is Filipa and I am a PhD student from the University of Palermo, Italy. As a visiting scholar at the Olive Centre, I study the influence of harvesting time and canopy position on the drupe maturation and olive oil quality. Starting my studies in Portugal I found a passion for fruit physiology that lead me to a master degree in horticultural sciences. During my master’s degree, I had the chance to learn more about the influence of agricultural practices on fruit minor compounds to improve their nutritional value. After developing my experimental work on the influence of irrigation and maturation on orange nutritional value in Italy, I choose to remain and apply for a PhD. For my PhD project, olives enter in my life! I study the Sicilian olive germplasm collection and the cultural factors affecting olive oil quality. At the Olive Centre, you can find me either in the lab or in the fields among olive trees! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, cooking and most of all travelling. I had the opportunity to travel, work and live in different countries but here in California the olive center lab-group made me found a new home!

<p>Hi! My name is Xavier Montalvan. I am a 5th year Chemistry major with an emphasis in Forensics. I am from Burbank in Southern California. I've always loved to eat olives and being in college having to cook for myself, I definitely use a lot of olive oil. When I heard about an opportunity to work for the UC Davis Olive Center, I had to take the chance. I started in Spring of 2017 and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I've learned so much about olive oils and all the chemical methods to test quality and there is still so much that I am learning each time I step into the lab. I also work for Unitrans driving and training, so the flexibility of the lab is great so I can balance school, work and the Olive Center. I look forward to the rest of my time with the Olive Center.
